# Product Sales Data Visualization Project

## Description

This project focuses on **data visualization for product sales**, aiming to extract valuable insights for market analysis. By transforming raw sales data into interactive and informative visualizations, we can identify trends, patterns, and anomalies to support strategic business decisions.

-----

## Features

  * **Interactive Visualizations:** Generate dynamic charts and graphs to explore sales data.
  * **Market Trend Analysis:** Identify key market trends and consumer behavior.
  * **Data-driven Insights:** Provide actionable insights for business strategy.

-----

## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need:

  * **Python 3.12**
  * `pip` (Python package installer)
  * `virtualenv` (for isolated development environments)

-----

## Dependencies

The project relies on the following Python libraries:

  * `fastexcel`: For fast Excel file processing.
  * `jupyter`: For interactive data exploration and notebook development.
  * `matplotlib`: A foundational library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
  * `numpy`: For numerical operations and array manipulation.
  * `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
  * `polars`: A DataFrame library for high-performance data operations.
  * `pyarrow`: For efficient data interchange, especially with Parquet files.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### 1\. Create a Virtual Environment

It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

### 2\. Activate the Virtual Environment

**Linux/macOS:**

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3\. Install Dependencies

Once your virtual environment is active, install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4\. Run the Project

Execute the main application file:

```bash
python main.py
```

the ouput of the program is in /report/figures/ path.

-----

## Code Quality

This project adheres to strict code quality standards.

### Code Formatting

To automatically format the code, ensuring consistency across the project:

```bash
ruff check
```

### Code Linting

To identify and report stylistic errors, programming errors, and suspicious constructs:

```bash
mypy src
```
